        Lincoln, NE
        <br>
        <p1>
            Lincoln NE is home to the Cornhuskers (also my in-laws), a football team that has been frankly disappointing for the last two decades ever since the retirement of our lord and savior Tom Osborne. Perhaps surprisingly, there is more to the city than football. The downtown scene is quite nice - 
            you can visit the farmer's market in the summer and pick up local groceries. A relatively large Vietnamese population means there is plenty of boba tea and pho to order. There are trails everywhere, parks everywhere, and Raising Cane's everywhere. The winter sucks though. Also the Chinese places kinda suck too, but I'm admittedly picky about those.
